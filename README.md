# Funky Pendulum

This is the continuation of the CartER projects undertaken by [Jeppe](https://github.com/JeppeKlitgaard/CartER/) and [Will](https://github.com/will-hd/CartER).

This repository mainly contains the control code and all the necessary components to construct one's own copy. Any questions about the code please feel free to contact [Ananya's cITB email](mailto:ananyapriyaroop@iitb.ac.in) or [Ananya's gmail](mailto:ananyapriyaroop@gmail.com) with a proper subject or leave in dicussion session in this GitHub repository.

## Getting Started

Download the zip file by clicking the **code** icon on the upper right corner. Download the following Python modules before running the code in the /src folder.

Necessary Python modules:
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib
4. pyserial
5. pandas

use `pip install module_name` to configure the corresponding module for your python

Necessary Arduino Libraries:
1. AccelStepper
2. AS5600
3. EasyButton

For uploading the Arduino code to the Arduino Board, you need to use Arduino IDE to download the above libraries and then upload the code to the microcontroller.

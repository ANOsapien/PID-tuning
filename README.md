# Funky Pendulum PID Optimisation

This is the continuation of the CartER projects undertaken by [Jeppe](https://github.com/JeppeKlitgaard/CartER/) and [Will](https://github.com/will-hd/CartER).

Based on the project accomplished by [Zhen and Owen](https://github.com/Zzzzhen1/Funky_Pendulum) during 2023 summer. This repository mainly contains the control code and all the necessary components to construct one's own copy of the swing-up mechanism of the pendulum and data analysis techniques of the same.

 Any questions about the code please feel free to contact [my college mail](mailto:ananyapriyaroop@iitb.ac.in) or [my gmail](mailto:ananyapriyaroop@gmail.com) with a proper subject or leave in dicussion session in this GitHub repository.

Steps to initialse the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Zzzzhen1/Funky_Pendulum) and for further details check out my [report](https://anosapien.github.io/CartER/)
